# CO‚ÇÇ Shield Generator

## Overview

The CO‚ÇÇ Shield lets you calculate the environmental impact of a webpage and display it in your GitHub project as a [shields.io](https://shields.io") badge, powered by [Beacon](https://digitalbeacon.co), which uses the [OneByte model](https://theshiftproject.org/en/lean-ict-2/) for calculating emissions created by The Shift Project.

## Live Tool

## Features

- **Badge Creation**: Generates a badge using the [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) service.

- **Rating Details**: Displays the CO‚ÇÇ emissions per webpage view, along with a breakdown of ratings.  

## How to Use

1. **Input a URL**: Type or paste the website URL you want to analyse. Ensure it's a valid web address.  
2. **Submit the Form**: Press "Enter" or click "Submit". The generator fetches CO‚ÇÇ data from [Beacon](https://digitalbeacon.co/).

## Rating System

The rating is based on the grams of CO‚ÇÇe produced per webpage view for new visitors. Returning visitors have a lower footprint due to caching. The ratings are defined as follows:

| Rating | Color                                | CO‚ÇÇe Emissions per View  |
|--------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| A+     | <span style="color:#58C521">‚óè</span> | Less than 0.095g         |
| A      | <span style="color:#20AE69">‚óè</span> | Less than 0.185g         |
| B      | <span style="color:#2D8EAC">‚óè</span> | Less than 0.34g          |
| C      | <span style="color:#C89806">‚óè</span> | Less than 0.49g          |
| D      | <span style="color:#C05328">‚óè</span> | Less than 0.65g          |
| E      | <span style="color:#B71E1E">‚óè</span> | Less than 0.85g          |
| F      | <span style="color:#652A2A">‚óè</span> | Above 0.85g              |
