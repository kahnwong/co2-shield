# COâ‚‚ Shield Generator

## Overview

The COâ‚‚ Shield Generator lets you calculate the environmental impact of a webpage and display it in your GitHub project as a [shields.io](https://shields.io") badge, powered by [Beacon](https://digitalbeacon.co), which uses the [OneByte model](https://theshiftproject.org/en/lean-ict-2/) for calculating emissions created by The Shift Project.

## Live Tool

## Features

- **Badge Creation**: Generates a badge using the [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) service.  
- **Markdown Output**: Provides a markdown snippet to embed the badge in project documentation.  
- **Rating Details**: Displays the COâ‚‚ emissions per webpage view, along with a breakdown of ratings.  

## How to Use

1. **Input a URL**: Type or paste the webpage URL you want to analyse. Ensure it's a valid web address.
2. **Submit the Form**: Press 'Enter' or click 'Submit'. The generator fetches COâ‚‚ data from [Beacon](https://digitalbeacon.co/).
3. **View Results**: See the badge, the markdown snippet, and the detailed COâ‚‚ emissions data.  
4. **Copy Markdown**: Use the 'Copy' button to copy the badge's markdown and embed it in your projects.
5. **Reset**: Use the 'Reset' button to analyse another webpage.

## Example

## Rating System

The rating is based on the grams of COâ‚‚e produced per webpage view for new visitors. Returning visitors have a lower footprint due to caching. The ratings are defined as follows:

| Rating | Colour                                                    | COâ‚‚ Emissions per View |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| A+     | ![A+](https://via.placeholder.com/15/58C521/000000?text=+)| Less than 0.095g       |
| A      | ![A](https://via.placeholder.com/15/20AE69/000000?text=+) |Less than 0.185g        |
| B      | ![B](https://via.placeholder.com/15/2D8EAC/000000?text=+) | Less than 0.34g        |
| C      | ![C](https://via.placeholder.com/15/C89806/000000?text=+) | Less than 0.49g        |
| D      | ![D](https://via.placeholder.com/15/C05328/000000?text=+) | Less than 0.65g        |
| E      | ![E](https://via.placeholder.com/15/B71E1E/000000?text=+) | Less than 0.85g        |
| F      | ![F](https://via.placeholder.com/15/652A2A/000000?text=+) | Above 0.85g            |
